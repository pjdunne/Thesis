\chapter{Combinations and interpretations of run I searches for invisibly decaying Higgs bosons}
\label{chap:comb}

\section{Searches in other channels}
%!!Refer back to theory to introduce ZH and ggH searches

\section{Combination with prompt VBF search}
%!!Present combination

\section{Combination with the parked VBF search}
%!!Present combination

\section{Dark matter interpretations}
%!!At minimum present an update of spin independent cross-section limit against dark matter mass plot from prompt data EPJC paper
%!!Present progress on interpretations that is made between now and writing up
