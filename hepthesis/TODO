From Flip Tanedo:
"""
Hi Andy -- another question (sorry I have so many). I've been using hepthesis to tex up lecture notes since it provides a really nice framework for this. The one thing I've been having trouble doing, however, is writing notes in the margin. I've been trying to use the \marginpar command to jot down comments, but have had difficulty finding enough margin space.

The hepthesis command \setmainmatterextramargins{1cm} doesn't quite help since (1) it trims off of both left and right margins (not just "opposite page binding") and (2) it doesn't actually increase the amount of space that \marginpar can occupy.

I've had some success by doing the following in the preamble:
 \addtolength{\evensidemargin}{1in}
 \addtolength{\textwidth}{-1in}

This seems to increase the margin on the side of the page opposite the binding.

However, this affects the entire document, including the title page, front matter, back matter, etc. Is there a way to apply the above spacing only to the main matter?

From giuseppe.passino@elec.qmul.ac.uk:

I'm actually using kile on linux, and I'm keen on the error window facility of clicking on an error and being redirected to the error line, as well as the backward referencing facility by which you can insert source information in the dvi file and be redirected to the correspondent line in the tex file when clicking in the dvi.

Unfortunately, all this cool stuff with hepthesis does not work, since the comment.sty style is used, that wraps the source into a temporary comment.cut file that spoils everything. This is because you define mainmatter etc. as specialcomment. I changed them into \renewcommand, and this problem disappeared. I was anyway curious to know why you went for the comment style instead of a simpler \renewcommand. Hence this email. Additionally, maybe the problem I described above is a reason good enough for you to change the definition of mainmatter end friends..

Just to give you an example, this is the new mainmatter:

\let\@oldmainmatter\mainmatter
\def\BeginMainMatter{%
 %\@oldmainmatter%
 \@mainmattertrue
 \pagenumbering{arabic}%
 \adjustwidth[]{\@mainmatterextramargin}{\@mainmatterextramargin}%
 \begin{\@mainmatterspacing}%
}
\def\EndMainMatter{%
 \end{\@mainmatterspacing}%
 \endadjustwidth%
 \ignorespacesafterend%
}
\renewenvironment{mainmatter}{\BeginMainMatter}{\EndMainMatter}
