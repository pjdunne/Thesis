\chapter{Interpretations of Run 1 searches for invisibly decaying Higgs bosons}
\label{chap:interp}
As well as combining the results of the \ac{VBF} searches with other channels, it is also possible to interpret them as limits on other specific models. Interpretations of the \ac{VBF} search results in several \ac{DM} models are described in \SectionRef{sec:dminterp}.

%??CHECK PLOT AXIS LABEL SIZES AND THAT LEGEND TERMS ARE STANDARD OR IN TEXT

\section{Dark matter interpretations}
\label{sec:dminterp}
%??At minimum present an update of spin independent cross-section limit against dark matter mass plot from prompt data EPJC paper
%??Present progress on interpretations that is made between now and writing up
