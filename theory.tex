\section{The standard model of particle physics}
\label{sec:SM}
%!!Describe electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model
%!!Detail Higgs production and decays in order to motivate searching for invisible decays in the VBF channel

The standard model of particle physics (SM) is a quantum field theory describing the interaction of the particles currently thought to be fundamental with the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces. Its predictions which come solely from specifying the particles in the theory, the symmetries the theory respects, how they are broken and 18 free parameters have been tested in many different experiments in some cases up to one part in a trillion \cite{PhysRevLett.100.120801}. The Higgs boson was the final SM particle to be discovered, and in this section I will describe the SM focussing on the Higgs mechanism, before outlining the motivations behind and some candidates for physics beyond the SM (BSM).

\subsection{Symmetries and particles}
The Lagrangian of the SM is globally invariant under Poincar\'e group transformations and locally gauge invariant under the group $SU\left(3\right)_{C}\otimes SU\left(2\right)_{L}\otimes U\left(1\right)_{Y}$. For any theory Poincar\'e invariance guarantees that the theory respects the observed energy and momentum conservation in the universe, whilst local symmetries give interactions between the particles in the theory mediated by vector gauge bosons. %!!REFERENCE

The observed particles in the universe fall into two types, fermions and bosons. Fermions in the SM are spin half representations of the above symmetry groups. The vector bosons in the standard model emerge as a result of the gauge invariance described above %!!DISCUSS HIGGS
