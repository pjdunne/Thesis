hepthesis LaTeX class, by Andy Buckley <andy@insectnation.org>
--------------------------------------------------------------

hepthesis is a LaTeX class for typesetting large academic reports,
in particular PhD theses. It was originally developed for typesetting
a high-energy physics PhD thesis and includes some features 
specifically tailored to that application.

The basic usage is to place
\documentclass{hepthesis}
in the preamble of your document. If you're feeling sophisticated,
then you can make your own document class based on hepthesis by placing
\LoadClass{hepthesis}
in your own class definition file.

Please see hepthesis.pdf for detailed documentation. And have fun :-)
