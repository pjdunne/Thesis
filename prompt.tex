\chapter{Search for invisibly decaying VBF produced Higgs bosons in Run 1 prompt data}
\label{chap:prompt}
%Introduction to selection and challenges of jets+met, e.g. trigger, \ac{QCD}
As described in \ChapterRef{chap:theory}, searches for invisible Higgs boson decays are well motivated by their sensitivity to new physics, such as \ac{DM}. Because the invisible branching of an \ac{SM} 125 \GeV\, Higgs boson is very small, any observation made of invisible Higgs boson decays at the \LHC would be evidence for physics beyond the \ac{SM}. This chapter describes the search for invisible Higgs boson decays using data taken by CMS in 2012 with a promptly reconstructed trigger developed specifically for this analysis. The total integrated luminosity collected with this trigger that was certified for use in physics analyses was 19.5\invfb~. The analysis was published in \ReferenceRef{Chatrchyan:2014tja}.

\section{Event selection}
\label{sec:promptsel}
%describe backgrounds and motivate selection
In signal events it is expected that there will be two jets with a characteristic \ac{VBF} topology and a large amount of \MET. Several background processes, with significantly higher cross-sections than the signal process, can also produce events with these objects present. It is therefore necessary to design selection criteria, known as ``cuts'', to remove as many of these background events from the analysis as possible.

The most significant of these background processes is the production of a vector boson in association with jets, ``V+jets''. Leptonic decays of \PW bosons and \PZ boson decays to neutrinos both produce \MET and, due to the approximately 1000 times higher cross-section for vector boson production than Higgs boson production, there are many events where the associated jets have a \ac{VBF}-like topology. V+jets backgrounds with a \PW (\PZ) are referred to as ``\PW(\PZ)+jets''.
A further background process that can produce significant numbers of \ac{VBF}-like jets due to its very large cross-section is \ac{QCD} production of multiple jets (``\ac{QCD} multijets''). Whilst these multijet events have very little \MET from real invisible particles, it is possible for significant ``fake'' \MET to be caused by mismeasurement of the jets. The production of two vector bosons or top quarks can also lead to two jets and real \MET, although they have much lower cross-sections than the other background processes and their contribution is not as significant. %??relative cross-section

%trigger requirements and design
\subsection{Trigger}
\label{sec:prompttrig}
The trigger requirements can be viewed as the first stage of the event selection. Their primary role is to reduce the rate of events that must be recorded by the detector whilst retaining the maximum number of signal events. As described in \SectionRef{sec:triggers} the decision whether to keep an event must be made very rapidly, and, as a result, the object reconstruction algorithms used are less sophisticated, and the available detector resolution is worse, than those offline. The trigger criteria have therefore been chosen to be as loose as possible whilst maintaining the required rate reduction.

To pass the \ac{L1} trigger selection events are required to have \MET$>40$ \GeV. Events are then required to have \METnoMU$>65$\GeV\, and at least one pair of jets in the event which is \ac{VBF}-like to pass the \ac{HLT} selection. The \ac{VBF}-like requirements on the jets consist of requiring their $\eta$ separation, $\Delta\eta_{jj}$, be greater than 3.5, that they are in opposite forward/backward halves of the detector and that they have high invariant mass, $M_{jj}>800 \GeV$. The use of \METnoMU at trigger level ensures that events that are needed for the control regions used in the background estimation techniques described in \SectionRef{sec:promptbkg} are not rejected. Not requiring that the \ac{VBF}-like pair of jets also be the two highest \pt jets reduces inefficiencies caused by different \pt orderings in jets reconstructed by the trigger and by the offline reconstruction. The efficiency for events to pass the trigger as a function of their values of several offline variables, measured in single muon data collected using an uncorrelated trigger, is shown in \FigureRef{fig:prompttrigplots}. The measured trigger efficiency is applied as an event-by-event weight to all \ac{MC} samples.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Offline selection}
\label{sec:promptofflinesel}
%selection and motivation
The offline selection begins by requiring that events have no veto muons or electrons, as defined in sections \ref{sec:electrons} and \ref{sec:muons}, with \pt$>10$ \GeV. This lepton veto reduces the background from \PW and \PZ boson decays and also from top quarks. The two highest \pt jets in the event are then identified as the VBF tag pair. Tighter versions of the trigger selection are then applied. The tag jets are required to be in opposite forward/backward halves of the detector, to both have \pt$>50$ \GeV\, and $|\eta|<4.7$, to have $M_{jj}>1100$ \GeV\, and $\Delta\eta_{jj}>4.2$. \METnoMU is required to be greater than 130 \GeV. Because events with veto muons have been vetoed \METnoMU is in the case of the signal region identical to \MET. However, it is important for background estimation methods that \METnoMU and not \MET is used.

As well as the trigger based selection, further cuts are made to reduce the \ac{QCD} multijet background to a level much lower than the V+jets backgrounds. The two tag jets are required to have an azimuthal separation, $\Delta\phi_{jj}<1.0$, since multijet events with \MET due to mismeasurement are most likely to have their jets back-to-back in the detector, i.e. with $\Delta\phi_{jj}=\pi$. Events where there are any jets with \pt$>30$ \GeV\, between the two tag jets in $\eta$ are also vetoed. This \ac{CJV} is motivated by the lack of colour connection, described in \SectionRef{sec:higprod}, between the quarks in VBF production that makes the presence of such jets unlikely in genuine signal events.

The specific values of the cuts on each variable are chosen for three reasons. Firstly, the reconstruction algorithms for some objects are only well validated for certain values of \pt and $\eta$. This consideration decides the threshold for the \ac{CJV} and lepton vetos. Secondly, as can be seen from \FigureRef{fig:prompttrigplots}, the values of the offline variables where the trigger becomes fully efficient are in some cases much higher than the online cut. Because the variables used in the trigger are highly correlated, the offline cuts on all variables used in the trigger were chosen such that the trigger efficiency for the variable at that point is greater than 95\%. The region of phase space remaining after all cuts have been applied is called the signal region.

Finally, the values of the cuts are optimised to provide the best expected limit on \BRinv\, for a 125 \GeV\, Higgs boson, which is calculated using the method described in \SectionRef{sec:stats} with the background estimation carried out as in \SectionRef{sec:promptbkg} and the systematic uncertainties as described in \SectionRef{sec:promptsyst}. For the tag jet \pt and \MET, no improvement in the expected limit is seen by tightening the cut, so the requirement is at the 95\% efficiency point of the trigger. The distributions and cut values for several of the other variables used are shown in \FigureRef{fig:promptcontrolplots}. The full selection gives a $(6.8\pm 0.3)\times 10^{-3}$ efficiency for selecting events from invisible decays of a VBF produced 125 \GeV\, Higgs boson.

\section{Background estimation}
\label{sec:promptbkg}
As discussed in \SectionRef{sec:promptsel} there are several background processes which are capable of producing VBF-like jets in association with \MET. The analysis' event selection removes most of the events from these processes, however a significant number still remain and it is important to estimate this number precisely. Data-driven methods, where data ``control regions'', which are similar to the signal region, are used to estimate the most significant backgrounds. This data-driven approach is particularly important due to the very stringent kinematic requirements placed on the tag jets, which lead to high uncertainties on estimates taken from \ac{MC} alone. The particular method used to estimate each of the backgrounds will be described in this section.

\subsection{\PW$\rightarrow e\nu$ + jets}
\label{sec:promptwenu}
The ``$\PW$+jets'' background where the $\PW$ boson decays to an electron and an electron neutrino, $\PW\rightarrow e\nu$ is estimated using single electron events. All aspects of the event selection are the same as those used in the singal region, except for the electron veto, which is replaced with the requirement that there is exactly one tight electron, with $p_{T}>20$ \GeV, in the event and no other veto electrons. These requirements give a single electron control region with events with jets that have the same kinematics as those in the signal region, but which is dominated by $\PW$ boson decays to electrons.

The estimated number of $\PW\rightarrow e\nu$ events in the signal region is then estimated by using the ratio between the expected number of events in the signal and control regions from \ac{MC} to extrapolate from the number of events seen in data in the single electron control region using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:wdatabkg}
  N^{S}_{Exp}=\left(N^{C}_{Data}-N^{C}_{Bkg}\right)\cdot\frac{N^{S}_{MC}}{N^{C}_{MC}},
\end{equation}
where $N^{S}_{Exp}$ is the number of expected events in the signal region from this background process, $N^{C}_{Data}$ is the number of events seen in the control region in data, $N^{C}_{Bkg}$ is the number of events from other backgrounds in the control region estimated using \ac{MC}, which is expected to be small, and $N^{S}_{MC}$ and $N^{C}_{MC}$ are the numbers of events predicted by \ac{MC} to be in the signal and control regions respectively. The fact that estimations from \ac{MC} are only used in ratios or where they are expected to be small removes any dependence of the final background estimation on the overall rate of the process predicted by \ac{MC}, and instead allows the observed rate in data to be used. It is important that the shape of the variables which differ between the control and signal regions are well modelled by the \ac{MC}. The modelling of the shape of two key variables, the \MET and the electron \pt, are shown in \FigureRef{fig:promptwenu}, where it can be seen that whilst the overall rate is significantly different between data and \ac{MC}, the shape of the distribution is modelled well.  The inputs and results of the background estimation are shown in \TableRef{tab:promptwenu}.

\subsection{\PW$\rightarrow \mu\nu$ + jets}
\label{sec:promptwmunu}
The method used to estimate the background from $\PW$+jets where the $\PW$ boson decays to a muon and a muon neutrino, $\PW\rightarrow\mu\nu$, is very similar to that used for $\PW\rightarrow e\nu$. A single muon control region is used, again with identical selection to the signal region except for the modification of the lepton veto, in this case by replacing the muon veto with the requirement that there is exactly one tight muon, with \pt$>20$ \GeV, and no other veto muons. \EquationRef{eq:wdatabkg} is then used, with the control region now being the single muon control region, to estimate the number of events from $W\rightarrow\mu\nu$ expected in the signal region. The inputs and results of the background estimation are shown in \TableRef{tab:promptwmunu}, and distributions of the muon \pt and the \MET in the single muon control region are shown in \FigureRef{fig:promptwmunu}.

\subsection{\PW$\rightarrow \tau\nu$ + jets}
\label{sec:promptwtaunu}
The background from $\PW$+jets where the $\PW$ boson decays to a tau and a tau neutrino, $\PW\rightarrow\tau\nu$, is estimated using a single tau control region data-driven method. However, in this case the control region used has more differences from the signal region than those used above. The reason for these increased differences is that the reconstruction efficiency for tau leptons is significantly lower than that for electrons or muons, and they are also more likely to be misreconstructed as jets, causing the event to be vetoed by the \ac{CJV}. Altering the signal region by adding a requirement that there is exactly one tau with \pt$>20$ \GeV\, results in a region with only $3.76\pm 1.27\stat$ \PW+jets events expected. In order to increase the number of events in the single tau control region as well as adding the tau requirement, the \ac{CJV} is also removed. The resulting control region has $29.2\pm 3.61\stat$ \PW+jets events expected and thus a much lower statistical uncertainty.

The single tau control region has the same requirements as the signal region except that a requirement that there is exactly one tau with \pt$>20$ \GeV\, is added, and the \ac{CJV} is removed to increase the number of events in the control region, and thus reduce the statistical error on the estimation of this background. As there is no veto of tau leptons in the signal region the tau control region and the signal region are not mutually exclusive. However, as stated above the number of events in the signal region with identified taus is expected to be small, so the overlap is considered negligible.

%cross-check of tau discriminant https://indico.cern.ch/event/259915/session/1/contribution/2/attachments/458506/635408/tauid090713.pdf
In addition to the tau identification algorithm described in \SectionRef{sec:taus}, alternative algorithms were studied to check for better performance in terms of identification efficiency and fake rate. Specifically an alternative isolation algorithm was investigated which used an \ac{MVA} approach to estimate the isolation sum, as well as different working points for the anti-electron and anti-muon discriminators. The tau identification efficiency was found to be higher for both the alternative isolation algorithm and different working points for the anti-lepton discriminators, being twice as large if both were used compared to the standard tau identification. However, the rate of $\PW\rightarrow e\nu$ events being identified as $\PW\rightarrow\tau\nu$ was also significantly increased, going from 2\$ for the standard identification to 15\% where the alternative isolation and anti-lepton discriminators were used. It was therefore decided to use the tau identification described in \SectionRef{sec:taus}.

The final estimation of the background from $W\rightarrow\tau\nu$ is carried out using \EquationRef{eq:wdatabkg}, with the single tau control region with no \ac{CJV} being used as the control region. The inputs and results of the background estimation are shown in \TableRef{tab:promptwtaunu}, and distributions of the tau \pt and $\Delta\phi_{jj}$ in the single tau control region are shown in \FigureRef{fig:promptwtaunu}.

\subsection{\PZ$\rightarrow \nu\nu$ + jets}
\label{sec:promptznunu}
The background from \PZ+jets where the \PZ decays to neutrinos, $\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu$, is different from the \PW+jets backgrounds described above, in that nothing is required to be misidentified in order for these events to contribute to the signal region. The method used to estimate the $\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu$ background therefore differs slightly from that used above. The method uses a dimuon control region which selects events from the process $\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$. Due to this process being able to be mediated by a photon, the kinematics of the jets in $\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$ events can be different to those from $\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu$. The dimuon control region that is defined therefore has a requirement that the invariant mass of the dimuons be between 60 and 120 \GeV\,. The control region is otherwise identical to the signal region, except that the muon veto is replaced with a requirement that there are exactly two tight muons with \pt$>20$\GeV\, and no other veto muons.

As well as the possibility of different kinematics, $\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$ and $\PZ/rightarrow\nu\nu$ also have different cross-sections. The formula used to estimate the $\PZ/\rightarrow\nu\nu$ background takes this into account as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:zdatabkg}
  N^{S}_{Exp}=N^{C}_{Data}-N^{C}_{Bkg}\cdot\frac{\sigma\left(\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu\right)}{\sigma\left(\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu\right)}\cdot\frac{\epsilon^{S}_{VBF}}{\epsilon^{C}_{VBF}},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma\left(\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu\right)$ is the cross-section for $\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu$ and $\sigma\left(\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu\right)$ is the cross-section for $\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$. $\epsilon^{S}_{VBF}$ and $\epsilon^{C}_{VBF}$ are the efficiencies for $Z\rightarrow\nu\nu$ events to pass the signal region selection and $Z/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$ events to pass the control region selection respectively. As Z bosons can be created via either \ac{QCD} or electroweak processes, which both have different cross-sections and efficiencies $\epsilon^{S}_{VBF}$ and $\epsilon^{C}_{VBF}$ are a cross-section weighted average of the efficiency for both types of production, calculated as:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:zdataeffs}
  \epsilon^{S}_{VBF}&=\frac{ \sigma\left(\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu,EWK\right) \frac{N^{S}_{MC}\left(EWK\right)} {N_{gen}\left(\PZ \rm{mass},EWK\right)} + \sigma\left(\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu,QCD\right) \frac{N^{S}_{MC}\left(QCD\right)} {N_{gen}\left(\PZ \rm{mass},QCD\right)} } {\sigma\left(\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu,EWK\right) + \sigma\left(\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu,QCD\right)},\\
  \label{eq:zdataeffc}
  \epsilon^{C}_{VBF}&=\frac{  \sigma\left(\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu,EWK\right) \frac{N^{C}_{MC}\left(EWK\right)} {N_{gen}\left(EWK\right)} + \sigma\left(\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu,QCD\right) \frac{N^{S}_{MC}\left(QCD\right)} {N_{gen}\left(QCD\right)}  }{\sigma\left(\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu,EWK\right)+\sigma\left(\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu,QCD\right)}.
\end{align}
Where $EWK$ and $QCD$ donate where cross-sections or numbers of events are for electroweak or \ac{QCD} production of a $\PZ$ boson. $N_{gen}$ is the number of events in the Z+jets \ac{MC} sample at generator level. Due to only very small $\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu$ \ac{MC} samples being available the same $\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$ samples used for the \ac{MC} estimate of the control region number of events is used, with the leptons ignored and the production cross-section scaled to the appropriate value, to obtain an estimate from \ac{MC} of the number of events from the $Z\rightarrow\nu\nu$ process in the signal region. The generated dimuon mass for this sample was required to be greater than 50 \GeV\,so the cross-sections used in equations~\ref{eq:zdatabkg}, \ref{eq:zdataeffs} and \ref{eq:zdataeffc} are also calculated with this constraint. For the control region $N_{gen}$ is calculated after requiring that the mass of the generator level dimuon is between 60 and 120 \GeV, denoted by $\PZ \rm{mass}$ in equations~\ref{eq:zdataeffs} and \ref{eq:zdataeffc}.

The inputs to equations \ref{eq:zdataeffs} and \ref{eq:zdataeffc} are given in \TableRef{tab:promptznunueffs}. The cross-sections for electroweak $\PZ$ production were calculated at NLO using \textsc{VBFNLO} which specialises in vector boson production. The cross-section for \ac{QCD} production of $\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$ is calculated using \textsc{FEWZ} inclusively for all leptons and then divided by three to obtain the figure for muons only. This cross-section is then multiplied by the ratio between the cross-section for $\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu$ and $\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$, which which was calculated to be 5.651 at NLO using \textsc{MCFM}, to obtain the \ac{QCD} production cross-section for $\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu$. The inputs to \EquationRef{eq:zdatabkg} are given in \TableRef{tab:promptznunu}, with the exception of the ratio between the total production cross-sections for $\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu$ and $\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu$ which is taken to be the same 5.651 that it is found to be for \ac{QCD} production. This approximation is used because the electroweak contribution to the ratio is smaller than that from \ac{QCD} by more than a factor of one thousand and is therefore negligible. The distributions of \MET and $M_{jj}$ for a $\PZ$ control region with relaxed selection to ensure sufficient numbers of events are shown in \FigureRef{fig:promptznunu}, demonstrating that the \ac{MC} samples model the data distribution well.

\subsection{QCD}
\label{sec:promptacQCD}
%??maybe others that were tried
The \ac{QCD} multijet background remaining after the full event selection is mostly from events where jets are mismeasured. The size of the \ac{MC} samples available for studying this process is not sufficient for them to be relied upon to generate extrapolation ratios between a control region and the signal region. The remaining \ac{QCD} multijet background is therefore estimated using a so-called ``ABCD'' method. In this method four regions, A, B, C and D, are defined according to whether events pass or fail the \MET and \ac{CJV} cuts as shown in \FigureRef{fig:abcdmethod}. Region D is the signal region and regions A, B and C are three mutually exclusive control regions.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|l}
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{}&\multicolumn{1}{c}{Fail \MET} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Pass \MET} &\\
    \cline{2-3}
    Fail \ac{CJV} &\cellcolor{orange} A & \cellcolor{orange}B &\\
    \cline{2-3}
    Pass \ac{CJV} &\cellcolor{orange} C & \cellcolor{green}D &\\
    \cline{2-3}
  \end{tabular}

  \caption{A diagram of the regions used in the \ac{QCD} multijet ABCD background estimation method. Region D is the signal region and regions A, B and C are mutually exclusive control regions.}
  \label{fig:abcdmethod}
\end{figure}

The efficiency to pass the \MET and \ac{CJV} cuts can be determined from the ratios between regions A and B, and A and C respectively. The number of events expected in the signal region is then:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:abcd}
  \begin{split}
  N_{D}&=N_{A}\cdot\frac{N_{B}}{N_{A}}\cdot\frac{N_{C}}{N_{A}}\\
  &=\frac{N_{B}\cdot N_{C}}{N_{A}}
  \end{split}
\end{align}
Where $N_{A,B,C}$ is the number of events observed in region $A,B,C$ in data minus the number expected from V+jets or other minor backgrounds, i.e. the number of events in the region believed to be from QCD. This method relies on the probability of an event passing the \ac{CJV} being uncorrelated with the \MET of the event. This has been checked by comparing the \MET distribution, below 130 \GeV\,, for events which pass and fail the \ac{CJV}. The maximum fractional difference observed between bins of these two distributions is 40\%, so this is added as a systematic to the \ac{QCD} multijet background yield. The method was also tested in a region orthogonal to the signal region with all requirements the same as those of the signal region except $\Delta\phi_{jj}$ which was required to be greater than 2.6. In this test region which is expected to be \ac{QCD} dominated, the prediction agreed with the expectation within 15\%, which is within the systematic uncertainty on the method.

\subsection{Minor backgrounds}
\label{sec:promptminor}
In addition to the V+jets and QCD multijet backgrounds above which account for 94\% of the expected events in the signal region, there is also a small number of events expected from other minor backgrounds (single top quark production, top quark pair production and diboson production). Due to its small contribution this number of events is taken directly from \ac{MC}. The diboson backgrounds are simulated using \textsc{pythia 6}, the single top quark background is simulated using \textsc{powheg} and the top quark pair production and $\PZ/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\ell\ell$ backgrounds are calculated using \textsc{MadGraph}. The final estimate of the number of events from minor backgrounds in the signal region is $20\pm 8.2$(syst.), with 70\% of these expected to be from diboson production. %??cross-sections taken from CMS published analyses


\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:promptsyst}
The dominant uncertainties in the analysis are the statistical uncertainties on the V+jets backgrounds due to the number of data events observed in the control regions. In addition, as well as those mentioned in \SectionRef{sec:promptbkg} there are several further systematic uncertainties on the expected numbers of signal and background events, including the statistical uncertainties on the numbers of \ac{MC} events. These uncertainties are described individually below and the fractional uncertainty on the total expected number of signal and background events from all sources of uncertainty are summarised in \TableRef{tab:promptsysts}.
\subsection{Jet energy scale}
\label{sec:promptjes}
The true energy of a jet reconstructed by \ac{CMS} is not necessarily the same as the true energy of all the particle that make it up. As described in \SectionRef{sec:jec}, jet corrections are applied to correct for this. The correction for the ratio between reconstructed and true jet energy is referred to as the \ac{JES}. Uncertainties on the \ac{JES} come from several sources. The dijet \pt balance method for instance has uncertainties in the measured \ac{JES} from jet resolution bias. This bias is due to the \pt spectrum of jets being sharply falling with increasing \pt. This shaprly falling \pt spectrum leads to the well measured jet being used as the base for the balance method to be more likely to have fluctuated up in \pt than down. The main uncertainties in the photon/\PZ balance methods comes from the limited number of events in the samples used. The \ac{MC} correction is also different when measured with different \ac{MC} generators, which also leads to an uncertainty.

These uncertainties on the \ac{JES} give rise to an uncertainty on the energy of all jets in \ac{CMS} events. The impact of this uncertainty on the event yields expected and observed in this analysis was estimated be altering the \ac{JES} correction up by one standard deviation, ``JESUP'', and down by one standard deviation ``JESDOWN'', and recalculating the energy and momentum of all jets in each event. The \MET is recalculated taking into account the updated jet energies. Furthermore, as the jet energy scale uncertainty varies as a function of a jet's \pt and $\eta$, it is possible for the \pt ordering of the jets to change when the \ac{JES} is changed. The \ac{VBF} tag pair is therefore rechosen to be the new highest \pt pair of jets. 

After modifying the \ac{JES} the analysis selection is then reapplied and the resulting change in the expected signal and background yields is taken to be the uncertainty due to \ac{JES}. The second highest \pt jet's \pt in a W+jets \ac{MC} sample is shown for the nominal \ac{JES}, JESUP and JESDOWN in \FigureRef{fig:promptjes}. It can be seen that altering the \ac{JES} results in a smooth change in the jet \pt, and the difference in numbers of events passing the 50 \GeV cut present in analysis is not due to individual events with large weights.

  \caption{The \pt distribution of the second highest \pt jet present in W+Jets \ac{MC} events with the nominal \ac{JES} and for JESUP and JESDOWN.}
  \label{fig:promptjes}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Jet energy resolution}
\label{sec:promptjer}
The width of the jet energy distribution, the \ac{JER}, differs between \ac{MC} and data. This is partly due to \ac{MC} samples being generated before and during data taking, and thus before a measurement of the exact resolution in data can be performed. Measuring the \ac{JER} in data is done in a very similar way to the measurement of the \ac{JES} using dijet and photon/\PZ-jet balance techniques in data and by comparing the reconstructed energy to that generated in \ac{MC}, and thus has the same sources of uncertainty.

To correct the \ac{MC} resolution to match that in the data the \pt of all jets in \ac{MC} is ``smeared''. The smearing is carried out using two methods. The first method is used for jets in \ac{MC} that are within 0.5 in the $\eta-\phi$ plane of a generator jet. In this method the difference between the reconstructed and generator jet \pt is scaled by a correction factor, $c$, chosen to be the ratio between the resolution of the data and \ac{MC} and calculated as a function of the jet's \pt and $\eta$. The resulting jet \pt is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:promptjermatched}
  \pt'=\rm{max}\left[0,p_{\mathrm{T}gen}+c\left(\pt-p_{\mathrm{T}gen}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
where \pt is the initial \pt, \pt' is the \pt after smearing and \pt$_{gen}$ is the matched generator jet's \pt. This procedure has the advantage that the smearing is not reliant on random factors and is therefore reproducible, making synchronisation between analysis implementations easier.

The second method is used where a jet has no matching generator jet. In this case a random correction is necessary. The technique used is to add a random gaussian fluctuation to the jet's \pt with width:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:promptjerunmatched}
  \sqrt{\left(c^{2}-1\right)\sigma_{MC}},
\end{equation}
where, $c$ is the same correction factor from the method above and $\sigma_{MC}$ is the intial \ac{MC} resolution as a function of \pt and $\eta$. As well as being random and thus difficult to reproduce, this method also has the disadvantage that it can only be used to worsen the resolution. 

The analysis is performed three times with three different smearings, one where the MC resolution is smeared to match the nominal data resolution, which is used for the main signal and background estimations and two where the \ac{MC} resolution is made to match the improvement, ``JERBETTER'' and worsening, ``JERWORSE'' of the jet energy resolution by one standard deviation. For the nominal and JERWORSE smearings the limitation of the unmatched jet smearing method to only worsening the resolution is not a problem, as the initial \ac{MC} resolution is better than that in data for all values of jet \pt and $\eta$. However, for the JERBETTER smearing it is necessary to improve the resolution for some jets. Fortunately, the differences between the generated resolution and the JERBETTER resolutions where improved resolution is required are small, so in these cases no smearing is applied. For all smearings the resulting changes in jet \pt are propagated through to the \MET. The differences between the signal and background yields obtained with the nominal \ac{JER}, JERBETTER and JERWORSE are used to assign an uncertainty due to the \ac{JER}.

\subsection{Unclustered energy scale}
\label{sec:promptues}
In addition to the uncertainties on the \MET from the propagation of \ac{JES} and \ac{JER} uncertainties there are also uncertainties from the other elements contributing to the \MET. Electrons and muons contribute to the \MET, but have very good resolution and small scale uncertainties compared to jets so their contribution to the \MET uncertainty is considered negligible. Unclustered energy, which is made up of all of the energy deposits in the calorimeters not identified as part of an object, such as a jet or lepton, still contribute to the \MET, and have a non-negligible scale uncertainty. 

The unclustered energy scale is meausred using photon and \PZ events with jets present in them, where it can be assumed that the \MET should be zero~\cite{CMS-PAS-JME-12-002}. After jet energy corrections the distribution of the remaining difference between the photon or \PZ momentum and the jets is therefore centered around zero, and its width can be taken as the uncertainty on the unclustered energy scale. The unclustered energy scale in all events is modified up and down by this uncertainty and the \MET recalculated. The differences in the obtained signal and background event yields obtained through this process are used as the uncertainty from this source.

\subsection{Lepton identification and isolation efficiency}
\label{sec:promptlepweights}
As described in \SectionRef{sec:mcweights} \ac{MC} events are reweighted using scale factors to account for differences in the efficiency of electron and muon identification and isolation criteria. The weights due to these efficiencies are varied up and down by the uncertainties from the tag and probe method used to measure them and the resulting signal and background yield differences used as the uncertainty from this source.

An uncertainty of 8\% is added to the estimate of the $\PW\rightarrow\tau\nu$ background to account for the uncertainty in the tau identification efficiency, which is measured using $\PZ\rightarrow\tau\tau$ events where one tau decays to a muon and the other hadronically~\cite{Chatrchyan:1385560}. 5\% of events in the $\PW\rightarrow\tau\nu$ control region also appear to be due to $\PW\rightarrow e\nu$ events where the elctron or a jet has been misreconstructed as a tau, so a further 5\% systematic is assigned to the $\PW\rightarrow\tau\nu$ estimate.


\subsection{Other uncertainties}
\label{sec:promptzextrap}
Additional uncertainties arise from several sources. For instance, the $\PZ\rightarrow\nu\nu$ background estimate is reliant on the ratio of the cross-sections for the \Znunu and \Zmumu. A 20\% uncertainty on this ratio was applied to cover the difference between the value of the ratio calculated using \textsc{MadGraph} and using \textsc{MCFM}. Further uncertainties come from the measurement of the distribution of the number of primary vertices used in the pileup weights, described in \SectionRef{sec:mcweights}, the \ac{pdf}s and \ac{QCD} scale used in signal cross-section measurements, the cross-sections used to normalise the minor backgrounds, and the measurement of the total integrated luminosity that the data used for the analysis correspond to.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:promptresults}
The final results of all the background estimation methods and systematic uncertainty studies are summarised in \TableRef{tab:promptresults}. The final number of events expected from background processes in the signal region is $332\pm 46\stat\pm 45\syst$. Assuming the presence of a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 \GeV\,, \ac{SM} production and \BRinv$=100\%$, $224\pm 31$ signal events would be expected, with 6\% of these from \ac{ggH} and the remainder from \ac{VBF} production. 390 events are observed, which is within one standard deviation of the background only prediction. \FigureRef{fig:promptresults} shows the \MET and $M_{jj}$ of the background and signal events expected, and the data observed, in the signal region.

As no excess is observed, the asymptotic $CL_{S}$ technique described in \SectionRef{sec:stats} is used to place an upper limit on the production cross-section times branching fraction, $\sigma\times\mathcal{B}$, at 95\% CL. Under the assumption of \ac{SM} production this limit can be interpreted as a limit on \BRinv. All systematic uncertainties are modelled as log-normally distributed nuisance parameters, with the exception of the statistical uncertainty on the $Z\rightarrow\nu\nu$ background, which is modelled as a gamma-normally distributed nuisance due to the low number of events in the dimuon control region. The resulting upper limits are shown as a function of Higgs boson mass in \FigureRef{fig:promptlimits}, with the 95\% CL observed (expected) limit on \BRinv for a 125 \GeV\, Higgs boson being 65\% (49\%).
