\chapter{Dark matter interpretations of Run 1 searches for invisibly decaying Higgs bosons}
\label{chap:interp}
As well as combining the results of the \ac{VBF} searches with other channels, it is also possible to interpret them as limits on other specific models. Interpretations of the \ac{VBF} search results in several \ac{DM} models are described in \SectionRef{sec:dminterp}.
