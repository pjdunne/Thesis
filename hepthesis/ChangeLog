2014-08-27  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* 1.5.0 release.

	* Changing example doc font, and removing mythesis.sty/cls files
	in favour of a preamble.tex

	* Tweaking use of frontmatter, mainmatter, backmatter
	etc. environments and using afterpage to ensure that page
	numbering and header styling works more consistently. Apologies
	that this took so long,
	cf. http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/170231/page-numbering-transition-from-frontmatter-to-mainmatter-going-wrong/

2012-08-02  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Make \frontquote/\pagequote set the "empty" page style, and
	minor updates in the example document, including forcing the first
	page of the first main chapter to be page 1, via judicious use of
	\pagenumbering{arabic}.

	* Remove dependence on siunitx in the example -- this needs to be
	sorted out properly in hepunits.

2011-01-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fix too-early page numbering: thanks to Steven te Brinke.

2010-05-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* 1.4.3 release.

	* Upgrading to use changepage in place of deprecated chngpage
	package, and a few other fixes. Also tidying some of the example
	document, improving the example makefile, and demonstrating
	sub-figure references with continued captions. Thanks to Ben Wynne
	for the heads-up.

2009-02-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed Makefile to put all the relevant files from example into
	the tarball.

2008-07-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Ready for *real* 1.4.2 release (more than a month after the
	first attempt!)

	* Added lots of TODOs and merges for the next version; removed
	mention in the manual of "cite" as a mandatory package.

2008-07-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Recursive make is used (warnings about incomplete DAGs be
	damned) and SCons has been ditched for now.

	* Bundled style files are now hidden by a zip file rather than the
	weirdo "*.hidden" renaming thing.

2008-05-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Hiding style files bundled with the example, since they can get
	accidentally picked up in recursive kpathsea lookups if *TEXINPUTS
	is set that way.

	* Fixes to makefile etc. SConstruct now works for building LaTeX
	documents... use it for building future versions.

2007-12-05  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed serif headers --- the sfheaders package is no longer
	needed, since sfheaders are the default in scrbook.

2007-09-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updated documentation about changed mandatory packages, some
	package clashes, and improved example formatting with framed
	boxes.

	* Added a couple of required earliest release dates to the
	\RequirePackage lines.

	* Added subfig/continued caption example chapter to the example
	thesis.

	* Removed subfig reqirement.

2007-07-03  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added command arguments etc. to the documentation.

	* Improved dedication command alignment as for \pagequote.

2007-07-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed "Appendix" label from the colophon page (copied from the
	book class thebibliography environment).

2007-06-30  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Improved the positioning of the \pagequote using the varwidth
	package - getting csquotes to work with the likes of fancybox was
	a nightmare.

	* Sorted out some extra \cleardoublepage effects that resulted
	from re-using the frontmatter and mainmatter definitions.

2007-06-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Improved the horizonal and vertical centering of the page quote.

	* Restricted the width of the document in the page and chapter
	quotes.

	* The front quote is now implemented with the name \pagequote and
	\frontquote is an alias via \let. This is just to give a better
	name, should someone decide to use it somewhere other than at the
	front (not that I'm recommending that!)

	* Added 1.5 cm to each margin in the abstract and declaration
	pages - I think this looks better since they are likely to be
	short sections.

	* Added the chngpage mechanism for adding extra margin widths on
	section by section bases.

2007-06-27  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added the \set...spacing commands and the variables that they influence.

2007-06-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added optional language argument to \frontquote and \chapterquote. These
	use the csquotes commands \enquote and \foreignquote if csquotes is loaded.

2007-06-11  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added definite v1.5 to \thesis... command deprecation notices.

	* Tidied up, and removed a few obsolete references to
	\thesis... commands in the user guide.

2007-06-10  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added the "plainpages=false" fix to hyperref package loading to
	stop the pdfTeX "destination with the same identifier" warning.

	* Incorporated a variety of improvements from Albert Neum√ºller:
	  + Babel integration and \enquote
	  + Using subfig rather than subfigure
	  + Introduced penalties to stop enumeration breaking across pages
	  + Using KOMA-script base classes to fix some errors with onepage mode
	  + Avoiding fancyhdr warnings in onepage mode.

	* Fix to make sfheaders.sty only be loaded if the sftitles option
	is in force. Thanks to Stuart Cook for the bug report and fix.

2006-09-28  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updated date to today, ready for release 1.3.

2006-09-25  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updated example document to demonstrate the bold math in titles
	and sans-serif titles.

2006-09-21  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Made frontmatter centered titles have \LARGE size rather than
	\Large.

	* Added \boldmath to the definition of \bfseries so that maths in
	titles etc. will automatically go bold. Thanks to Donald Arsenau
	for supplying this neat trick!

2006-09-18  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed a bug in the definition of \definethesis (argument #2 was
	never used).

	* Added sftitles option, using the sfheaders package and some
	changes to the hepthesis-specific sectioning commands. Updated
	documentation to reflect this.

2006-06-12  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Updated the documentation to reflect the recent changes.

	* Removed some lingering \thesis-prefixed commands from the
	examples.

	* Aliased \maketitle to \titlepage{} (see below).

	* Changed behaviour of \titlepage slightly: the first argument
	will no longer be presented prefixed with "of" (so you should
	include "of\\ " in the argument if you want the original,
	non-internationalised behaviour). Also, the first argument is now
	optional, so should be wrapped with square brackets rather than
	curly braces. \thesistitlepage has been similarly updated.

	* Deprecated \definethesis command: it is now just a thin wrapper
	for \title and \author.

	* Added titling option to use the titling package if
	available. Otherwise, redefine \title and \author to save their
	arguments in \thetitle and \theauthor, as well as in \@title,
	\@author, so that they are available in the document body, in
	particular for building the title page.

2006-06-06  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Prompted by a request from Claudia Strabel, the table, figure,
	figure* and sidewaysfigure environments now use standard [!htbp]
	placement specifiers.

2006-02-23  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Ready for version 1.2 release (no changes since 2006-01-26 and
	no reported bugs from beta testing)

2006-01-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Added appendices and colophon environments and updated the
	manual and example accordingly.

	* Changed mainmatter environment to a special comment so that it
	doesn't remove the section numbering until the backmatter starts:
	I don't understand what it is about \renewenvironment that was
	doing this.

	* Fixed typo in backmatter definition which made it treat the
	backmatter as mainmatter.

2005-12-13  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Removed pdfpagemode=FullScreen option from hyperref. Maybe
	re-introduce this sort of thing via an option.

2005-12-09  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Fixed typo ("latex" -> "pdflatex") in the documentation of how
	to use a Makefile to ease the PS/PDF conditional compilation
	issues.

	* Moved frontquote text up by 1.5 cm to balance the page a bit
	better. This is still quite A4-specific: maybe this should be
	specified in terms of \textheight?

	* Added dedication page command and added some \cleardoublepage
	and page style commands to the quote page command to ensure that
	it doesn't overlap with the contents pages.

2005-11-01  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Hacked the example files into much better shape and updated the
	documentation to mention the new features and the pre-defined figure widths.

	* Added the "deprecated" typeout into the thesis-prefixed commands
	and environments.

	* Added a sidewaysfigure environment, which introduces a
	dependency on the rotating package. It's very standard, so I'm not
	bothered. Maybe add an option to disable the rotating dependency later...

	* Added the hide{front,back,frontback} options.

2005-09-26  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Finished off the first version of the documentation. Example
	files could do with some work which I'm too lazy to do right now
	:-)

	* Added the \Chapter, \ChapterRef etc. commands from a personal
	style file.

2005-09-02  Andy Buckley  <andy@insectnation.org>

	* Changed \oddsidemargin and \evensidemargin settings to use the
	\@bindextramargin length.

	* Added bindnopdf option.

	* Started ChangeLog entries. Oops, I should have started a bit
	earlier, eh?
