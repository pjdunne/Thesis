%??CHECK PLOT AXIS LABEL SIZES AND THAT LEGEND TERMS ARE STANDARD OR IN TEXT

\section{Searches in other channels}
%??Refer back to theory to introduce ZH and ggH searches

\section{Combination with prompt VBF search}
%??Present combination

\section{Combination with the parked VBF search}
%??Present combination

\section{Dark matter interpretations}
%??At minimum present an update of spin independent cross-section limit against dark matter mass plot from prompt data EPJC paper
%??Present progress on interpretations that is made between now and writing up
